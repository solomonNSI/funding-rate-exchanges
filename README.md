### This repository contains python scripts to get all funding rate history data

1. It loops through the api to get all the data
2. I tried to keep the csv similar to all the exchanges, might be small differences
3. It has timestamp + string date
4. I think it is sorted in increasing order
5. OKX only gives data for the last 3 months
6. Deribit creates a lot of file, need to fix that sometime
